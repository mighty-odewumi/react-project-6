# react-project-6


The project was to build dark mode toggle functionality into a React Info site.   

I learnt about conditional rendering in React using the && and also the ternary operator.

 
### I didn't add the whole React files but that's on purpose. Would probably deploy later but that is how I would do the remaining projects too.


Here are the screenshots of the page on the localhost.
